abstract = { Heterogeneous memory (HM, also known as hybrid memory) has become popular in emerging
parallel architectures due to its programming flexibility and energy efficiency. Unlike
the traditional memory subsystem, HM consists of fast and slow components. Usually,
the fast memory lacks hardware support, which puts extra burdens on programmers and
compilers for explicit data placement. Thus, HM provides both opportunities and challenges
with programming parallel codes. It is important to understand how to utilize HM and
set expectations on the benefits of HM. Prior work principally uses simulators to
study HM, which lacks the analysis on a real hardware. To address this issue, this
paper experiments with a real system—the TI KeyStone II—to study HM. We make three
contributions. First, we develop a set of parallel benchmarks to characterize the
performance and power efficiency of HM. It is the first benchmark suite with OpenMP
4.0 features that is functional on real HM architectures. Second, we build a profiling
tool to provide guidance for placing data in HM. Our tool analyzes memory access patterns
and provides high-level feedback at the source-code level for optimization. Third,
we apply the data placement optimization to our benchmarks and evaluate the effectiveness
of HM in boosting performance and saving energy. },
